To run use the .jar included

The arguments are as follow

java -jar sdis.jar <IP-MC> <PORT-MC> <IP-MDB> <PORT-MDB> <IP-MDR> <PORT-MDR> <INTERFACE> <PORT-CHUNKS>

INTERFACE is the name of the network interface to be used (for example en0, en1)
PORT-CHUNKS is used to receive the chunks I ask for (in the version with enhancements)
